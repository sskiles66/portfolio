                <p>From an early age, I was fascinated by computers and how they worked but I didn’t know anyone that knew much more about computers than I did besides they work and that it seems like magic. Growing up, I assumed that computers were beyond my understanding and I ended up being passionate about running, dreaming of one day becoming an Olympic athlete. However, when medical issues plagued my ability to run more than 5 minutes, I turned to music to fill that hole in my life. I became very passionate about music (rock/metal specifically) and I ended up learning how to play the guitar, the bass, and how to sing. For a few years, I dreamed of joining a rock band and making a living out of that but then I realized that being a rock star is not a stable job so when I learned that my high school is offering an Intro to Computer Science class, I had to try it out. I quickly found myself loving the process of coding and solving the inevitable bugs that came about during the process. During my senior year of high school, I even took the AP Computer Science class to build upon my foundation. Once I graduated high school in 2020, I spent a year getting my Associate’s degree from Everett Community College in Washington and I started going to Brigham Young University - Idaho in January of 2022 to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. While I have been going to school at BYUI, I know that I am in the right field and I have become very passionate about learning and developing. I have become especially passionate about web development and I have been a member of the Web Development and Design Society at BYUI since April of 2022 and I have been the president of this society since April 2023.</p>
